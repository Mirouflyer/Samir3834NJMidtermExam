Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.

*A programming language is  a set of commands, instructions, and other syntax use to create a software program.


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.

*First JDK stands for Java Development Kit , it contains a suite of tools
Java compiler : this tool is used to compile the source code from a java file to a bytecode or file.class
JVM : it the Java Virtual Machine used to translate the byteCode and execute it ,
the JVM is composed of different components a class loader , a code verifier and a JIT (Just in time running)



What is IDE?
A.
*An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment that is used to write the source code of a programming language.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A.
*Eclipse,
*IntelliJ
*NetBeans


Explain the entire java life cycle.
A.
*It starts from the IDE where we write ou source code file.java .
*compile this source code by using java compiler or javac the result of that is a byteCode or a file.class.
*The byteCode is passing throw the JVM wich use a a class loader to upload it , next verify the code finally
execute it with the JIT (Just in time) compiler.


what is class?
A.
*A Class is a blueprint of an object.

What is object?
A.
*An object is an instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
A.
*The entry point of application is the main method.

Why main is static?
A
*main is static because it the entry point of the program so
the program run faster than if the main is not static
if not we have to instantiate the class where the main method is .
so this process takes much more time.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A.
*java.lang.Object

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A.
*Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.
*Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A.
*Main difference is methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations.
 A Java abstract class can have instance methods that implements a default behavior

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A.
*No we can't ,we need to implement the interface and extends the abstract class.

what is Access Specifier?
A.
*Access Specifier Java Access Specifiers regulate access to classes, fields and methods in Java.
These Specifiers determine whether a field or method in a class, can be used or invoked by another method in another
class or sub-class

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A.
*OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming.
-Abstraction : implementation hiding.
-Inheritance :
-Polymorphism :
-Encaplsulation: data hiding


What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A.
*Package in Java is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and interfaces.
*the package with no name. Second, the java.lang package.
And third, the current package (the package in which the current file is defined).

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A.
*API is Application Programming Interface that is a list of all classes that are part
of the java development kit.
-Scanner , BufferedReader, FileReader, LinkedList , HashMap , String ,

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A.
*No ,in order to avoid the ambiguity.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A-
*overloading a methods allows different methods to have same name,
 but different signatures where signature can differ by number of input parameters
 or type of input parameters or both.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A.
*An exception object is an instance of an exception class.
It gets created and handed to the Java runtime when an exceptional event
occurred that disrupted the normal flow of the application. ...
When a method throws an exception object, the runtime searches the call stack for a piece of code that handles it.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A.
*static keyword in java is a non access modifier

*The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
*The static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.



What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.
*final is non access specifier that is used  with the variables , methods and classes.
*when it is used with variable , this variable is constant.
*When it used with method, the method can't be overriding.

What is final, finally and finalize?
A.
*Final : Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable.
Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.

*Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not.

*Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.
What is a constructor ?
A.
*A constructor in Java is a block of code similar to a method that's called when an instance of an object is created.


Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A.
*Yes.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A.
*Default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A.
*this key word is a reference variable that refers to the current object.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A.
*The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent class objects.
*1.super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
 2.super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
 3.super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

What is JVM stand for ?
A.
*JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.

Is JVM platform independent?
A.
*Yes.

What version of java are you using?
A.
*Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_201-b09)

What is JAR stand for ?
A.
*JAR stands for Java archive.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.
*JVM is included in JDK.
JDK = JRE+Development tool

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A.
*JVM is included in JRE
*JRE = JVM+Library classes

What is compile time and run time?
A.
*compile time is Early binding
*run time is Late binding .

What is heap?
A.
*The heap is a memory segment that is used for dynamic allocations,

How java manage it's memory?
A.
*the memory in java is divided in three segment , the code segment ,the stack and heap
*the primitive variable and the reference variable in the stack .
*in the heap we store the class instances and arrays.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.
*String is immutable ( once created can not be changed )object . The object created as a
 String is stored in the Constant String Pool.
 Every immutable object in Java is thread safe ,that implies String is also thread safe . String
 can not be used by two threads simultaneously.
 String once assigned can not be changed

 *StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object . The object created
  through StringBuffer is stored in the heap. StringBuffer has the same methods as the
  StringBuilder , but each method in StringBuffer is synchronized that is StringBuffer is thread
  safe .

  *StringBuilder is same as the StringBuffer , that is it stores the object in heap and it can also
   be modified . The main difference between the StringBuffer and StringBuilder is
   that StringBuilder is also not thread safe.

What is Singleton class?
A.
*Singleton class restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures
that only one instance of the class exists in the java virtual machine.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A.
*Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
*Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.



when to use transient variable in java?
A.
*transient is a variables modifier used in serialization.
At the time of serialization, if we donâ€™t want to save value of a particular variable in a file,
then we use transient keyword. When JVM comes across transient keyword,
 it ignores original value of the variable and save default value of that variable data type.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A.
*in the while loop we check the condition than we execute the statements.
*in the do while loop execute once before checking condition.

What is Enum?

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A.
*Synchronized blocks in Java are marked with the synchronized keyword.
A synchronized block in Java is synchronized on some object.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
